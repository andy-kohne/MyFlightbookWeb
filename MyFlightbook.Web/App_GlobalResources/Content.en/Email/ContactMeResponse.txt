Thank-you for contacting %APP_NAME%.

We usually respond to requests within a few hours.  

However, I will be traveling with intermittant Internet access from June 25 - July 17, so it may be a few days before you get a response in that timeframe.  The FAQ on the site addresses many common questions; please give that a try.

Thank-you very much.
